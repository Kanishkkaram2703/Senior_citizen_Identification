# Senior Citizen Identification

## 1. Abstract

This project implements a deep learning-based system that can detect and classify people from video or webcam feeds. It predicts age and gender of each person, and if a person is 60 years or older, it marks them as a senior citizen. Detected age, gender, and timestamp are saved into a CSV file for further analysis. This system is especially useful for malls, stores, or public places to track senior citizens and demographic data.

## 2. Introduction

### Problem Statement:
Malls and public places often require systems to analyze foot traffic, identify senior citizens for priority service, and log visit details. Manual tracking is inefficient and error-prone. This project aims to automate this process using AI.

### Objectives:

- Predict age and gender of people in real-time from video/webcam feed.
- Mark individuals aged 60+ as senior citizens.
- Store age, gender, and time of visit in an Excel/CSV file.
- Provide optional GUI interface for ease of use.

### Applications:

- Malls and retail environments for customer profiling.
- Queue management with senior citizen prioritization.
- Public health and demographic tracking.

## 3. Literature Review

- **Face Detection with MTCNN**: Efficient for detecting multiple faces in real-time.
- **Age and Gender Classification with CNNs**: Convolutional Neural Networks are effective for predicting continuous variables like age and categorical ones like gender.
- **Logging with CSV**: Simple and scalable way to store user data and timestamps.

## 4. Methodology

### Data Used:
- **UTKFace** or **IMDB-WIKI** dataset for training the model.
- Dataset includes face images with labeled age and gender.

### Preprocessing:
- Resize and normalize face images.
- Convert to grayscale or RGB depending on model input.
- Label encode gender (0: Male, 1: Female) and treat age as numeric.

### Model Training:
- CNN architecture with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Flatten, Dense.
- Two output heads: one for age (regression), one for gender (classification).
- Optimizer: Adam
- Losses: MSE for age, Binary Crossentropy for gender
- Evaluation: MAE (age), Accuracy (gender)

### Detection Flow:
1. Capture frame from webcam/video.
2. Detect all faces using MTCNN.
3. Predict age and gender for each face.
4. If age ‚â• 60, label as "Senior Citizen".
5. Draw bounding box and label.
6. Log details (age, gender, timestamp) in CSV.

## 5. Implementation

### Core Modules:
- `main.py`: Face detection, age & gender prediction, CSV logging.
- `model_training.ipynb`: Model building and training notebook.
- `utils.py`: Preprocessing and utility functions.

### Sample Logging Code:

```python
with open("visitor_log.csv", mode="a", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow([predicted_age, predicted_gender, datetime.now()])
```

Prediction Output Format:
Age: 67 (Senior)

Gender: Male

Logged at: 2025-05-27 10:23:45

**6. Results**
Age MAE: ~6.5 years

Gender Accuracy: ~90%

Real-Time Speed: ~5‚Äì10 FPS on CPU

Include a few screenshots of GUI or console output.

**7. Challenges and Limitations**
Challenges:
Varying lighting and camera quality.

Real-time multi-face detection latency.

Accurate age prediction for children/senior faces.

**Limitations**:
No GUI included by default (optional).

Limited to frontal face images.

Model misclassifies in low-light or blurry inputs.

**8. Conclusion**
The system effectively detects and logs senior citizens in real-time from video or webcam feeds. This solution can assist businesses, malls, and public systems in managing crowd demographics and offering services to the elderly with care.
